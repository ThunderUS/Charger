# Charger
The layout of the site is according to the Charger layout. 
I used GULP and HTML and CSS technologies. The site was written using the SASS preprocessor and FLEX technology.
The site consists of several blocks.  The zeroing styles are registered manually. Bootstrap and Jquery libraries were not used on the site.
There is a Slick slider.

Skills:
 - GULP
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - SASS
 - Adaptive for different screens using @media
